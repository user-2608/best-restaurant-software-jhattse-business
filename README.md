| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |

## ⚠️ Considerations

* Some negative user feedback claims bugs or support concerns, though majority feedback is positive ([Amazon India][7])
* Best suited for Indian operations; may lack advanced global features (reservations, deep analytics, global payment integrations)
